# Invoice Approval Demo App

A small invoice approval app used for live AI-in-SDLC demos. It is deliberately simple: a .NET 8 API, a plain web UI, and an in-memory store, so it runs with one command and no database.

## Run it

```
dotnet run --project backend/src/InvoiceApp.Api
```

Open http://localhost:5000 and sign in:

| User | Password | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `demo.manager` | `ChangeMe123!` | Manager (approves up to 50,000.00) |
| `demo.director` | `ChangeMe123!` | Director (approves up to 500,000.00; second approver above that) |
| `demo.director2` | `ChangeMe123!` | Director (a second, different director) |
| `demo.admin` | `ChangeMe123!` | Admin (can reject and delete, cannot approve) |

These are demo accounts for a local, in-memory app. They are not real credentials.

## What it does

1. Create an invoice (it starts as a draft).
2. Submit it for approval.
3. An approver approves it within their limit, or rejects it with a reason. Above 500,000.00 two different people must approve, the second a Director. See [spec 001](specs/001-approval-limits/spec.md).

Invoices move through Draft, Pending Approval, then Approved or Rejected.
